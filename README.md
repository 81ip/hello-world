# hello-world
This Repository is for me to learn Git and act as a testing playground
This is Day 13 in my Cyber journey. Working towards bettering myself and my career one lesson and one new application at a time.
Ive done alot so far and my mentor who started me on this path suggested keeping a tracker of my progress and also recommended Github. 2 weeks in here we are.
So far I have Created profiles on many sites and applications and completley overhauled my personal day to day.
